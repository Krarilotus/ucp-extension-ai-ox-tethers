# AI: Ox Tethers
Vanilla AI has an upper bound on three ox tethers per quarry, plus it always builds an ox tether when it places a quarry.

This combination leads to strange behavior as the game progress. This extension addresses this.

## Features
- Allow more than 3 ox tethers per quarry
- Customize the decision rules for placing more ox tethers
- Customize the rules per AI via the AIC
